 * @brief   A fake tensor class made for demo1 of the beginner-friendly tutorial
 *          to MLIR.
 *
 * This is a basic multi-dimensional tensor class used to abstract the data
 * allocations required to perform linalg operations. This is often controlled
 * by the linalg library and is very careful with how memory is managed to
 * achieve the best performance.

/**
 * @brief Basic 2D static-shaped tensor class.
 *
 * This can trivially be extended to dynamic-shaped, but for this demo I wanted
 * to keep things simple.
 *
 * NOTE: This type of class is necessary to define for a couple of reasons.
 *       First, C++ (and many programming languages) do not provide a continuous
 *       2D array of values. It is trivial to make one by linearizing the
 *       offset indices; however this is usually abstracted from the user.
 *       Second, high-performance libraries may use special classes to represent
 *       tensors to store more information on the data being stored in order to
 *       make their kernels even higher performance.
